This is a VAECL(Viewpoint Adaption Ensemble Contrastive Learning Framework) that uses a C-WDCGAN-GP(Conditional Wasserstein Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) to overcome the limited training data problem in classifying vessel types.
This was my first project and also my first venture into deep generative models.
This was a very good learning experience. This is heavily based upon the paper published by Xiaocai Zhang and Zhe Xiao.
